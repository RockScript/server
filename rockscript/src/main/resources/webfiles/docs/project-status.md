**RockScript does not offer any stability guarantees at this point.**
 
RockScript is proof-of-concept stage and the implementation is very volatile.

At this point we have a good start on the developer experience. You -as a 
curious, badass, rock star developer- can already try it as intended to get 
a good idea of what RockScript can do.  You can help us with your feedback.  
[Let us know](https://github.com/RockScript/server/issues/new) what you 
think of the RockScript concepts and goals.  Any question, suggestion or other 
other form of feedback is really appreciated.

Persistence is still only in-memory.  We plan to build persistence to 
a datastore (SQL or Kafka) once the developer experience is sufficiently done.

Also at this stage the 
[coverage of the JavaScript language](https://github.com/RockScript/server/wiki/RockScript-language) 
is still super super minimal.

I'm planning to build a business model on top of RockScript.  I'm looking for
a cofounder so if you think you have what it takes email me: tomatrockscriptdotio  
 
The plan is to provide [commercial offerings](http://rockscript.io/products) on top 
of the open source engine.

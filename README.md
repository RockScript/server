## Project status

**RockScript does not offer any stability guarantees at this point.**
 
RockScript is proof-of-concept stage and the implementation is very volatile.

At this point we have a good start on the developer experience. You -as a 
curious, badass, rock star developer- can already try it as intended to get 
a good idea of what RockScript can do.  You can help us with your feedback.  
[Let us know](https://github.com/RockScript/server/issues/new) what you 
think of the RockScript concepts and goals.  Any question, suggestion or other 
other form of feedback is really appreciated.

Persistence is still only in-memory.  We plan to build persistence to 
a datastore (SQL or Kafka) once the developer experience is sufficiently done.

Also at this stage the 
[coverage of the JavaScript language](https://github.com/RockScript/server/wiki/RockScript-language) 
is still super super minimal.

I'm planning to build a business model on top of RockScript.  I'm looking for
a cofounder so if you think you have what it takes email me: mail @ tombaeyens . be  
 
The plan is to provide following commercial offerings on top of the 
open source engine:

**RockScript Consulting** gets you in depth expertise to help you use RockScript 
in the best way for your project.  

**RockScript Service** is a serverless platform to deploy, test, monitor and 
administer RockScripts.

**RockScript On-Premise** is an on-premise version of the SaaS product UI that can 
be installed on your own servers.

## License

The full RockScript runtime server and command line interface is Apache License V2.  

The commercial web UI and SaaS version of RockScript will not be open source, even 
though some parts of the SaaS UI might be free.
